        <p>Haneeth is a very popular Yemeni dish of slow roasted lamb that’s marinated in a mixture of spices and slow roasted 
            until the meat is so tender it nearly falls off the bone.</p>
        <h2>What do you need to make this dish?</h2>
        <p>Lamb: I used about 1.5 lbs of lamb meat with bone, and I chose to use lamb shanks which I recommend for how tender 
            and delicious they turn out.</p>

            <p>Green onions, chives, and garlic cloves: These are blended with the other marinade ingredients. Interesting 
                preparation but it works to tenderize the meat and add a lot of flavor!</p>
            <p>
                Spices: Cumin powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, cinnamon powder, whole cloves and cardamom pods, bay leaves
            </p>
            <p>
                Dried or preserved lemon (lumee): This is totally optional, so don’t worry if you can’t find them. 
                They are a very pungent, dry, black dried lemon (or lime) that are often used in Khaleeji cooking. 
                I like adding a couple to the roasting pan while the lamb cooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Olive oil and Butter: These are blended with the marinade ingredients and are used to coat the lamb. 
                This will give a great moistness to the inside of the lamb and slightly crispy roasted exterior.
